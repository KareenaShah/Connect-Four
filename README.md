# Connect-Four
‘ConnectFour’ is a simple duel player classic game. It is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe only instead of 3, the player must try to bring 4 of its checkers in a row, column or diagonal.

A player gets only a limited time to make his/her desired move. Once the player has exceeded the time limit, he/she loses the turn and the next player makes a move. There are 3 levels with different time limit. In the Beginner level, the player gets 30 sec, in Novice, the player gets 20sec and in Hard, the player gets 10 sec to make a move. 

Points are rewarded to the winner based on the level chosen. All this combines to give an excellent experience of a classic game ‘ConnectFour’
